## Rotunda of Endless Hours

The rotunda rotates every hour, aligning brass mirrors that project constellations onto the marble floor. Scholars record the shifting pattern in duodecimal stanzas, muttering "tempus fugit" as bells chime.

### Access Protocol

To reach the archive stacks, a warden must enter a keyphrase into the automaton scribe:

```yaml
sequence: ["aurora", "meridian", "vesper"]
checksum: "Δ42"
```

Failure to comply results in temporal displacement lasting 3d6 minutes; survivors report déjà vu and lingering frost on their sleeves.

## Librarian of Spirals

Curator Nyla maintains a ledger of visitors with annotations in Old Velnari:

- "Συνεχής" — granted extended access to the Spiral Annex.
- "следопыт" — escorted to the Observatory despite prior ban.
- "wanderer" — denied entry; aura registered unstable harmonics.

### Temporal Fallout Scenario

Should the archive's chronolock fail:

1. Chime order reverses, forcing all portals shut.
2. Celestial projections desynchronize, revealing hidden staircases.
3. A dormant construct labeled **PROJECT ÉCHOS** awakens, reciting prophecies in alternating Elvish and binary.
