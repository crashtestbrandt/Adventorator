Carefully examine the requirements for each story in <!-- EPIC_FILE-->, along with related ARCH documentation, ADRs, and contracts. 

Then, for each story: produce a detailed, defensive, test- and contract-first, task-based implementation plan. Add your plan to new STORY documents in docs/implementation/stories/ (replacing any existing TASK items with more granular ones if necessary) along with updated Definition of Ready (DoR), Definition of Done (DoD) and Acceptance Criteria sections as appropriate.

Then, update traceability linkages throughout related documentation.
