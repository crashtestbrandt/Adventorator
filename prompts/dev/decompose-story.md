Carefully examine the requirements for <!-- STORY_FILE -->, along with its related Epic, ADRs, and contracts. 

Then, produce a detailed, defensive, test- and contract-first, task-based implementation plan for implementing the story. Add your plan to the STORY document (replacing any existing TASK items with more granular ones if necessary) along with updated Definition of Ready (DoR), Definition of Done (DoD) and Acceptance Criteria sections as appropriate.

Then, update traceability linkages throughout related documentation.
