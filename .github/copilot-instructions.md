## Copilot Instructions (Delegated)

All authoritative agent, architecture, workflow, and coding conventions are consolidated in `AGENTS.md`.

Agents: Do not rely on (or expand) this file. Always open and follow `AGENTS.md` for up-to-date guidance. If instructions need revision, edit `AGENTS.md` only and keep this redirect file unchanged.

Nothing else belongs here.
