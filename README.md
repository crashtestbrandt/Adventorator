# Adventurator

*Dungeon Master as a Service (DMaaS)*

A Discord-native Dungeon Master bot that runs tabletop RPG campaigns directly in chat. It blends deterministic game mechanics with AI-powered narration, letting players experience a text-based campaign without needing a human DM online 24/7.

## Overview

**‚ú® Features (MVP and beyond)**

* Discord-first gameplay
* Slash commands (/roll, /check, /sheet, /act) and interactive components (buttons, modals).
* Combat threads with initiative order, per-turn locks, and timeouts.
* Ephemeral prompts for individual player actions.
* Deterministic rules engine
* Full SRD 5e dice system (advantage/disadvantage, crits, modifiers).
* Ability checks, saving throws, AC, HP, conditions.
* Initiative and turn management with audit logging.
* Campaign persistence
* JSON-schema character sheets stored in Postgres (or SQLite for dev).
* Adventure content as structured ‚Äúnodes‚Äù (locations, NPCs, encounters).
* Automatic transcripts and neutral session summaries.
* AI-assisted narration (behind feature flag)
* LLM proposes DCs and narrates outcomes; Rules Service enforces mechanics.
* Retrieval-augmented memory: previous sessions, adventure nodes, campaign facts.
* Configurable tone, verbosity, and house rules.
* Developer experience
* Python 3.10+, FastAPI interactions endpoint, Redis for locks/queues.
* Pydantic models, property-based tests for dice & checks.
* Structured JSON logs, reproducible seeds, feature flags for every subsystem.

**üèó Architecture**

* Discord Interactions API ‚Üí FastAPI app ‚Üí defer in <3s ‚Üí enqueue background job.
* Rules Service (pure Python functions) ‚Üí resolves rolls, DCs, initiative, mutations.
* Database ‚Üí campaign state, character sheets, transcripts.
* Optional LLM ‚Üí narrates and proposes rulings, never mutates state directly.
* Workers ‚Üí long-running tasks: narration, summarization, content ingestion.

**üîí Design philosophy**

* AI narrates, rules engine rules. No silent HP drops or fudged rolls.
* Human-in-the-loop. GM override commands (/gm) and rewind via event sourcing.
* Defensive defaults. Feature flags, degraded modes (rules-only if LLM/vector DB down).
* Reproducible. Seeded RNG, append-only logs, golden transcripts for regression tests.

**üöß Status**

* [X] Phase 0: Verified interactions endpoint, 3s deferral, logging.
* [X] Phase 1: Deterministic dice + checks, /roll and /check commands.
* [ ] Phase 2: Persistence (campaigns, characters, transcripts).
* [ ] Phase 3: Shadow LLM narrator, proposal-only.
* [ ] Phase 4+: Combat system, content ingestion, GM controls, premium polish.

**üîú Roadmap**

* Add /sheet CRUD with strict JSON schema.
* Initiative + combat encounters with Redis turn locks.
* Adventure ingestion pipeline for SRD or custom campaigns.
* Optional Embedded App for lightweight maps/handouts in voice channels.

## Prerequisites

- Bash-like environment
- Docker
- Python > 3.10
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

    ```bash
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```

- [cloudflared](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/)

    ```bash
    # Linux
    wget https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-arm
    sudo cp ./cloudflared-linux-arm /usr/local/bin/cloudflared
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cloudflared
    cloudflared -v

    # MacOS
    brew install cloudflared
    ```

## Quickstart

```bash
cp .env.example .env    # <‚Äî Add secrets
make dev                # Install Python requirements
make run                # Start local dev server on 18000
```

### Optional: Anonymous Cloudflare tunnel:

```bash
make tunnel
```

In the output, you should see something like:

    ```
    2025-09-05T18:57:54Z INF |  Your quick Tunnel has been created! Visit it at (it may take some time to be reachable):  |
    2025-09-05T18:57:54Z INF |  https://rooms-mechanics-tires-mats.trycloudflare.com  
    ---

Discord can now reach your dev server using that URL + `/interactions`.

## Development

**Guiding Principles**

* LLM augments, rules engine rules. All state changes go through deterministic code.
* Always ack in ‚â§3s. Immediately defer and finish work off-thread.
* Everything behind feature flags. Roll forward/Rollback without deploy.
* Shadow first. New subsystems run in observation mode before taking action.
* Write once, test twice. Unit+property tests for math; golden logs for flows.
