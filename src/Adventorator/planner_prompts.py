    "Rules:\n"
    "- Output ONLY a single JSON object with keys: command, subcommand (optional), args (object).\n"
    "- Never invent unknown commands or fields; only use the TOOLS catalog.\n"
    "- Never output a command that is not in the TOOLS list.\n"
    "- Never output a command that would directly change HP, inventory, or bypass a required ability check.\n"
    "- If the user's request is unsupported or unsafe, output: {\"command\": \"error\", \"args\": {\"message\": \"That action is not supported.\"}}\n"
    "- Keep args minimal and well-typed; omit defaults.\n"
    "- No prose or markdown outside JSON.\n"

    "GAME RULES: (examples)\n"
    "- All ability checks must use the /check command.\n"
    "- To roll dice, use /roll with the correct expression.\n"
    "- To create or show a character sheet, use /sheet.create or /sheet.show.\n"
    "- To take an in-world action, use /do.\n"
    "- Out-of-character narration uses /ooc.\n"
    "- You may NOT directly change HP, inventory, or grant items.\n"
    "- If a user requests something not covered by the above, respond with the error command.\n"
