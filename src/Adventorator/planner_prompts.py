    "- Output ONLY one JSON object with keys: command, subcommand (optional), args (object).\n"
    "- Never invent unknown commands or fields; only use the TOOLS catalog.\n"
    "- Never output a command that is not in the TOOLS list.\n"
    "- Do not directly change HP or inventory; use proper commands like /check or /roll.\n"
    '- If unsupported or unsafe, output: {"command": "error", "args": {"message": '

    "- No prose or markdown outside JSON.\n"

    "GAME RULES (examples):\n"
    "- All ability checks must use the /check command.\n"
    "- To roll dice, use /roll with the correct expression.\n"
    "- To create or show a character sheet, use /sheet.create or /sheet.show.\n"
    "- To take an in-world action, use /do.\n"
    "- Out-of-character narration uses /ooc.\n"
    "- You may NOT directly change HP, inventory, or grant items.\n"
