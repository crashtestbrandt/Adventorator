Welcome to Greenhollow, a quiet township at the edge of the Heartlands. Rumors whisper of a luminous crystal — the Skyshard — whose fragments are said to mend the weary and banish creeping corruption.

At the south gate, Alric Stone greets wary travelers. In the shrine, Seraphina Dawn tends to the hopeful. Beyond the palisade, an old watchtower crumbles under ivy and time. Yet at night, a strange glow pulses from its heart.

Hooks:
- A caravan failed to arrive from Northbridge.
- Shepherds report a hulking figure near the ruins.
- The Wayfarers' Guild posts a bounty for signs of the Skyshard.
