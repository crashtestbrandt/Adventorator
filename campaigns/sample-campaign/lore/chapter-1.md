As dusk paints the palisade orange, the south gate stands vigilant. Alric Stone signals a patrol. Tracks along the cart road deviate toward the old watchtower, heavy and clawed.

Complication: A traveler feigns injury to lure guards away. A successful Wisdom (Insight) check reveals staged blood and a concealed blade.

Outcomes:
- Expose the ruse: Gain Alric's trust and a favor from the Wayfarers' Guild.
- Fall for it: The watchtower’s occupant gains time to prepare an ambush.
