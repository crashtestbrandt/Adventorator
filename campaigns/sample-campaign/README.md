# Sample Campaign Pack — Greenhollow & The Skyshard

This is a richly detailed example campaign data pack designed for Adventorator. It’s original content compatible with the D&D 5e SRD (v5.2.1) ruleset and adheres to the import architecture in ARCH-CDA-001.

Contents:
- Entities (NPCs, locations, items, organization, creature)
- Edges (residency, control, and spatial adjacency)
- Ontology (tags and affordances)
- Lore (intro and chapters)

Validate locally:
- Manifest: python scripts/demo_manifest_validation.py --package-path campaigns/sample-campaign
- Entities: python scripts/demo_entity_import.py --package-path campaigns/sample-campaign

A package.manifest.json will be generated with content hashes in a later step.
