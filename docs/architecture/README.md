# Architecture Overviews

Use this directory to collect C4 diagrams, system overviews, and other Epic-level architecture references.

## Getting Started
- Store generated diagrams (PNG/SVG) alongside their editable sources (PlantUML, Structurizr DSL, etc.).
- Link these artifacts from Feature Epics and Stories using the GitHub templates added in Phase 1.
- Keep filenames scoped by epic or bounded context, e.g., `encounter-context.puml` and `encounter-context.png`.

These assets should remain synchronized with the decisions recorded in [`../adr`](../adr) to satisfy the AIDD traceability requirements.
