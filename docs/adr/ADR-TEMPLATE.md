# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

## Title
A short, descriptive title (e.g., "Use GraphQL for API contracts").

## Status
Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-XXX

> Include date and decision owner; keep ADRs immutable after "Accepted" (create a new ADR to change course).

## Context
What problem are we trying to solve?
What constraints or forces are shaping the decision?
Whatâ€™s the background (e.g., related epics, stories, or incidents)?

## Decision
The decision we made, in full sentences.
(Include diagrams, snippets, or contracts if relevant.)

> If contracts change, link exact versions (e.g., OpenAPI commit hash) and deprecation policy. Note any backward/forward compatibility guarantees.

## Rationale
Why this decision?
What alternatives were considered, and why not chosen?
What tradeoffs or risks are we accepting?

## Consequences
* Positive outcomes (what this enables, simplifications).
* Negative outcomes (new risks, added complexity, migration costs).
* Future considerations (when might this decision be revisited?).

## References
* Links to related ADRs, epics, stories, contracts.
* External references (RFCs, docs, benchmarks).
