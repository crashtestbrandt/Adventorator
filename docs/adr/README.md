# Architecture Decision Records

This directory houses architecture decision records (ADRs) that document durable design choices for Adventorator.

## Usage
- Create a new ADR file named `ADR-XXX-title.md` using [`ADR-TEMPLATE.md`](./ADR-TEMPLATE.md) as the starting point.
- Reference the relevant Feature Epic, Story, and Task issues in each ADR to maintain traceability.
- Once an ADR is accepted, do not edit it retroactivelyâ€”add a follow-up ADR if the decision changes.

The structure mirrors the [AIDD reference templates](https://github.com/crashtestbrandt/AIDD/blob/main/TEMPLATES.md) and ensures the governance artifacts introduced in Phase 1 stay consistent.
