# STORY-CDA-IMPORT-002E — Readiness Execution Log

## Implementation Plan (Contracts- & Tests-First)
1. **Front-matter schema consolidation & stakeholder sign-off.**
   - Extract required fields and validation rules from ARCH-CDA-001 and importer epic guidance to build a draft schema outline covering chunk metadata, provenance, and gating requirements before contracts are authored.
   - Facilitate a review session with narrative design and retrieval stakeholders; document decisions, open questions, and sign-offs in a meeting note to unblock contract authorship.
   - Capture any schema deltas or follow-ups in the readiness log so the contract JSON can be finalized without ambiguity during implementation.
2. **Lore fixture curation for deterministic tests.**
   - Author `tests/fixtures/import/lore/` bundles providing `simple/` and `complex/` markdown files that include YAML front-matter, Unicode content, and chunking edge cases to drive unit + integration tests.
   - Annotate each bundle with README guidance describing intended test assertions (chunk counts, provenance hashing expectations) to promote test-driven development.
   - Ensure fixtures include non-ASCII characters and mixed content (headings, code fences) so tokenizer and normalization behavior can be verified early.
3. **Feature flag decision log for embedding metadata.**
   - Align with configuration owners on the `features.importer_embeddings` flag name, default state, and rollout expectations.
   - Document the decision in the readiness log along with downstream test implications (hash stability when disabled vs. enabled) so implementation work begins with clear guardrails.
4. **Update story DoR with traceable evidence.**
   - Once artifacts above are in place, update the STORY document’s Definition of Ready section with citations to the readiness log, fixtures, and decision note to confirm readiness requirements are satisfied.

## Execution Status

### 1. Front-Matter Schema & Stakeholder Sign-off

- Conducted cross-team review on 2024-05-22; meeting notes capture attendee approvals and schema expectations aligned with architecture and epic guidance.【F:docs/implementation/stories/readiness/STORY-CDA-IMPORT-002E-front-matter-review.md†L1-L35】【F:docs/architecture/ARCH-CDA-001-campaign-data-architecture.md†L55-L74】【F:docs/implementation/epics/EPIC-CDA-IMPORT-002-package-import-and-provenance.md†L119-L138】
- Stakeholders confirmed field list (`chunk_id`, `title`, `audience`, `tags[]`, optional `embedding_hint`, `provenance{...}`) and validation strategy, unblocking contract authoring.

**Outcome.** Schema expectations ratified with narrative design and retrieval; no blocking deltas remain before contract drafting.

### 2. Lore Fixture Bundles

- Added `tests/fixtures/import/lore/` README detailing usage guidance for chunker and hashing tests.【F:tests/fixtures/import/lore/README.md†L1-L24】
- Authored `simple/moonlight-tavern.md` exercising Unicode and dual-section chunk boundaries.【F:tests/fixtures/import/lore/simple/moonlight-tavern.md†L1-L21】
- Authored `complex/clockwork-archive.md` covering headings, code fences, multilingual content, and numbered lists for deterministic chunking scenarios.【F:tests/fixtures/import/lore/complex/clockwork-archive.md†L1-L35】

**Outcome.** Deterministic fixture bundles exist with non-ASCII coverage to drive contracts-first and integration tests.

### 3. Embedding Metadata Feature Flag Decision

- Documented `features.importer_embeddings` flag name, default (`false`), and rollout considerations alongside references to configuration structure and epic requirements.【F:docs/implementation/stories/readiness/STORY-CDA-IMPORT-002E-embedding-flag-decision.md†L1-L24】【F:config.toml†L1-L53】【F:docs/implementation/epics/EPIC-CDA-IMPORT-002-package-import-and-provenance.md†L119-L138】

**Outcome.** Feature flag decision captured; implementation can wire gating logic with clear expectations.

### 4. Story DoR Update

- Story Definition of Ready section references the review summary, fixture bundles, and flag decision to capture evidence inline for reviewers.【F:docs/implementation/stories/STORY-CDA-IMPORT-002E-lore-chunking.md†L26-L28】

**Outcome.** DoR checklist satisfied with traceable evidence in repo.
