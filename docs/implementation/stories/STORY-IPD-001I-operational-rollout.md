# STORY-IPD-001I — Operational hardening and rollout

Epic: [EPIC-IPD-001 — ImprobabilityDrive Enablement](/docs/implementation/epics/EPIC-IPD-001-improbability-drive.md)
Status: Planned
Owner: Operations WG

## Summary
Apply guardrails, SLOs, and rollout plan with canary+rollback.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Timeouts and payload bounds enforced with safe defaults; observability in place.
- Rollout plan defines dev, canary, GA with rollback triggers and owner on-call.

## Tasks
- [ ] TASK-IPD-TIMEOUT-24 — Implement timeout/payload knobs.
- [ ] TASK-IPD-RUNBOOK-25 — Document rollout/canary plan with escalation.

## Definition of Ready
- Operations review completed.

## Definition of Done
- Runbook linked; dashboards or mockups attached.
 - Flag policy validated (defaults disabled unless documented exception); canary toggles enumerated with owners.

## Test Plan
- Chaos-style tests for timeouts/bounds; manual canary checklist.

## Observability
- Dashboards or logs to track ask.* and kb.* counters; SLOs defined.

## Risks & Mitigations
- Canary regressions: clear rollback criteria and scripted disable.

## Dependencies
- Stories B, C, F, H for signals and controls.

## Feature Flags
- Uses all relevant feature flags to stage rollout.

## Traceability
- Epic: EPIC-IPD-001
- Implementation Plan: Phase 6 — Operational Hardening and Rollout

---

## Alignment analysis — IPD↔CDA (embedded)

- Coordinate rollout stages with CDA events enablement plan; require pre-enable checks (idempotency v2 shadow, hash chain observability) before allowing any AskReport persistence or planner-driven event creation.
