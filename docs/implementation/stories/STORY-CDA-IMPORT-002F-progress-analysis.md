# STORY-CDA-IMPORT-002F — Implementation progress review

## Summary
The codebase contains a full in-memory implementation of the finalization phase, including schema artifacts, orchestration wiring, and a comprehensive unit/integration test suite. The current implementation satisfies large portions of the acceptance criteria but leaves several production-readiness gaps (ledger persistence, warning aggregation, and real digest mismatch handling) that should be addressed before declaring the story done.

## Acceptance criteria coverage
- ✅ **Completion event schema and parity tests.** The contract `contracts/events/seed/import-complete.v1.json` defines the required payload fields, types, and patterns for `seed.import.complete`, and the tests load this schema to validate emitted payloads.【F:contracts/events/seed/import-complete.v1.json†L1-L72】【F:tests/importer/test_importer_finalization.py†L231-L276】
- ✅ **Completion event implementation.** `FinalizationPhase.finalize_import` composes counts, digest, duration, and warnings (placeholder) into the payload, emits the event/logs, records the histogram metric, and returns an ImportLog summary.【F:src/Adventorator/importer.py†L1598-L1681】 Unit tests cover happy path emission and feature-flag short-circuiting.【F:tests/importer/test_importer_finalization.py†L21-L69】
- ✅ **ImportLog consolidation.** `_create_import_log_summary` enforces contiguous sequence numbers, surfaces gaps via structured logging, and appends a summary record containing the manifest hash/digest metadata.【F:src/Adventorator/importer.py†L1709-L1769】 Tests verify summary contents and that gaps raise `ImporterError` while logging diagnostics.【F:tests/importer/test_importer_finalization.py†L70-L148】
- ✅ **Deterministic fold helper.** `ImporterRunContext` aggregates manifests, per-phase ImportLog entries, and canonical digest components using the shared hashing helper, ensuring reproducible state digests.【F:src/Adventorator/importer_context.py†L1-L277】 Tests cover deterministic hashing, ordering independence, failure injection, and golden fixture parity.【F:tests/importer/test_state_digest.py†L17-L315】【F:tests/importer/test_state_digest_fixture.py†L1-L39】
- ✅ **Duration metric and structured logging.** Finalization records `importer.duration_ms` via the repository histogram helper and emits a final summary log including counts, digest, and duration.【F:src/Adventorator/importer.py†L1659-L1674】 Tests assert the metric call executes; logging content is indirectly validated through the gap-detection test and event emission log assertions.【F:tests/importer/test_importer_finalization.py†L138-L175】
- ✅ **Replay integration.** `run_complete_import_pipeline` wires the finalization phase into the production flow, and replay tests run the pipeline twice against the golden fixture to assert identical digests, counts, and contiguous ImportLog sequences.【F:src/Adventorator/importer.py†L1804-L1881】【F:tests/importer/test_state_digest.py†L317-L381】

## Gaps and follow-ups
- ⚠️ **Warning aggregation stub.** Finalization always emits an empty `warnings` array because no phase populates warning data or passes it into the context. Implement a shared warning collection mechanism before shipping to production.【F:src/Adventorator/importer.py†L1646-L1649】
- ⚠️ **Digest mismatch response not implemented.** Tests simulate mismatch logging manually, but no production code compares computed digests to stored expectations or raises when divergences occur. Introduce a persistence layer (e.g., ImportLog summary lookup) that verifies and reacts to mismatches in finalization.【F:tests/importer/test_state_digest.py†L267-L315】
- ⚠️ **Contract validation fallback.** The schema test falls back to manual assertions when `jsonschema` is absent, which misses pattern/enum enforcement; consider vendoring the validator or building a lightweight schema checker to guarantee parity in CI.【F:tests/importer/test_importer_finalization.py†L254-L276】
- ⚠️ **Observability assertions.** Structured log content (counts, digest, duration) is not explicitly asserted; add log-capture tests to guarantee field coverage per the story requirement.【F:src/Adventorator/importer.py†L1659-L1671】
- ⚠️ **Event ledger/idempotency persistence.** The replay integration verifies deterministic payloads and ImportLog sequences but does not assert the absence of duplicate ledger writes because the ledger is not yet wired. Plan follow-up work to connect finalization to the real event store and extend the test to observe ledger state.【F:tests/importer/test_state_digest.py†L317-L360】

## Overall assessment
The repository demonstrates strong progress toward STORY-CDA-IMPORT-002F: schema artifacts, finalization orchestration, ImportLog consolidation, deterministic digest computation, and replay/idempotency scaffolding are in place with thorough automated tests. The remaining work is primarily around production hardening—persisting digests, aggregating warnings, capturing structured logs, and asserting contract compliance with a guaranteed validator. Addressing these gaps will align the implementation with the story’s Definition of Done.
